Quick'n'dirty GamesDoneQuick-PHP-API

This library serves as a quick (and currently incomplete) way to access the GamesDoneQuick API in PHP 7.1 and above.
So far you're able to access an event (SGDQ2017, AGQQ2018), all of it's runs and associated runners in an OO-manner.

For example usage, take a look at the "examples"-folder.
